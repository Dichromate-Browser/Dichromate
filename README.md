# Dichromate
A Chromium based browser that focuses on privacy and security that was made to keep the shambling corpse of [Hexavalent](https://github.com/Hexavalent-Browser/Hexavalent-Archive) alive after its untimely death. It is released under a new name and logo to avoid copyright infringement. 

New features will be few and far between. 

# Things to keep in mind

Dichromate is a hobbyist browser and should not be used in production. Updates may not be timely.
